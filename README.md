# ShadowLayout
A simple Android app to test a custom layout that enables a cast shadow for all its children. Made for the needs of the floating snake game

Built in Android Studio

Note: The shadows don't change with contents of the layout in real time and are manually updated, this worked perfectly fine for the needs of Floating Snake. This project was aimed at developing the ShadowLayout module to be used with Floating Snake and this app itself was just used for testing.
